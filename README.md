# ELK Stack with Bro, Snort, and Packetbeat

This repo holds all the configuration files that I use for my 3D network data visualization, [Ergo Witness](http://ergowitness.info).
 
 More broadly this holds all the necessary information to install the ELK stack and use it with Bro, Snort, and Packetbeat on both RPM Linux distros and Debian Linux distros.
